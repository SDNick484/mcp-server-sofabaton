"""Domain layer: one hub, reached through sofabaton-x-server, MQTT (X2 only), or both.

Which path a call takes:
  reads    the server when it has a session with the hub (any mode: in observe
           mode it serves its cache); otherwise MQTT.
  control  the server when it is in control mode; otherwise MQTT (an X2 with
           MQTT set up keeps working while the Sofabaton app holds the proxy);
           otherwise an error that says why and what would fix it.

Names in, ids out: the model says "Watch Shield"; each path resolves names
against *its own* catalog and sends ids from that catalog. Ids never cross
from one path to the other, because nothing says the X2's MQTT ids match the
server's (ASSUMPTION S-MQTT-IDS). The catalog is also the allow-list.

A 200 proves nothing. The server's "accepted" means the hub took the frame,
so starts and stops are confirmed: by polling the server's view, or by the
X2's own MQTT announcement, with a list re-read as the fallback.

Capabilities (reported by get_status, so the model knows what this hub can do):
  activities, buttons, commands   list/start/stop, hard buttons, named commands
  find_remote, hub_info           need sofabaton-x-server
  presses                         Wifi-Device key presses (server, or MQTT on an X2)
  live_activity_state             X2 + MQTT: changes pushed as they happen
  control_while_app_open          X2 + MQTT: commands work while the app holds the proxy
