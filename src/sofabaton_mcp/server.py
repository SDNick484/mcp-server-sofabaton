"""MCP tool definitions.

Same shape as the Harmony sibling, on purpose: activity-first, with buttons
and commands going through the running activity unless a device is named.

Models: the X1, X1S and X2 all work through sofabaton-x-server; the X2 can
also be reached over MQTT, alone or alongside the server (client.py picks the
path per call). So the model can plan around what a given hub can do,
get_status reports ``model``, ``capabilities`` and ``limitations``, and a tool
that can't run on this hub says why and what would enable it rather than
failing vaguely. The server instructions say the MQTT features are X2-only.

Docstrings are the model's documentation; signatures become JSON Schema.

Status: verified against the simulator only (see assumptions.py).
